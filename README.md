# GeneticAlgorithmOpt

GeneticAlgorithmOpt is a optimization tool using Genetic Algorithm , developed by [Jia LIU].

No tool box is needed. Add the path to your Matlab, then you can use it.

This code can only handle discrete optimization problems. For continuously varied parameter problems please check the Particle swarm optimization repository.
